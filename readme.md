## Fun with primes in Clojure

An implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes for finite and infinite sequences, for printing a pretty multiplication table of the first n prime numbers.

It takes about 30s on my Intel Core i5 to find the first 300 primes and multiply them out. Surely this could be optimized further.

See also the Sieve of Atkin, a significantly fancier approach (requiring enumeration of the solutions to some quadratic forms) with better asymptotic complexity.
